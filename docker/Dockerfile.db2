# Dockerfile for IBM DB2 on ARM64 (Experimental)
# This is highly experimental as IBM does not officially provide ARM64 Docker images or direct installation packages for DB2.
# Success is not guaranteed and may require specific IBM installation media for ARM64 Linux.

# Use an ARM64 compatible Ubuntu base image
FROM --platform=linux/arm64 ubuntu:latest

# Download and extract DB2 installation media (PLACEHOLDER - THIS URL WILL LIKELY NOT WORK)
# You will need to obtain the correct ARM64 DB2 installation media from IBM.
# This step assumes the installer is a tar.gz file containing the installable binaries.

# Attempt to install DB2 (This part is highly dependent on the actual installer structure)
# This is a generic attempt and might need significant adjustments based on the actual DB2 ARM64 installer.
# You might need to run db2setup or db2_install script with specific options.
# For example, if the extracted directory is 'server_r', you might do:
# RUN /tmp/server_r/db2setup -r /tmp/db2setup.rsp
# A response file (db2setup.rsp) would be needed for unattended installation.
# For a basic server edition, it might look like:
# RUN /tmp/server_r/db2_install -f SERVER

# Placeholder for actual DB2 installation commands
# This section needs to be customized based on the actual DB2 ARM64 installer and your desired configuration.
# For demonstration, we'll just create a dummy directory to simulate installation.
RUN mkdir -p ${DB2_INSTALL_DIR}
RUN echo "DB2 installation placeholder for ARM64" > ${DB2_INSTALL_DIR}/README.txt

# Switch to the db2inst1 user
USER db2inst1
WORKDIR /home/db2inst1

# Expose the default DB2 port
EXPOSE 50000

# Command to start DB2 (placeholder - actual command will vary)
# This will depend on how DB2 is installed and configured.
# For example, if you have a working DB2 instance, you might start it with:
# CMD ["db2start", "&&", "tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]
CMD ["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"] # Keep container running for debugging
