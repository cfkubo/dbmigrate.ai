# Summary of Fixes and Improvements

This document summarizes the changes made to address the issues identified in `current_state.md`.

## 1. Redundant Conversion/Verification Logic
*   **Fix:** The redundant `verifier/main.py` script has been deleted. All conversion and verification logic is now consolidated within `worker.py` to ensure a single, consistent job processing flow via RabbitMQ.

## 2. Incomplete Schema Comparison
*   **Fix:** The `api/schema_comparer.py` file, which contained incomplete and unused `sqlcompyre` integration, has been deleted. The project now exclusively relies on AI-powered schema comparison via `ai_converter.compare_schemas_with_ollama_ai`.

## 3. Missing `log_migration_row_status` Implementation
*   **Fix:** The `log_migration_row_status` function in `api/database.py` has been fully implemented. It now correctly updates the `data_migration_jobs` table by incrementing `migrated_rows` or `failed_rows` and appending error details based on the status of individual row migrations. This involved:
    *   Adding a `failed_rows` column to the `data_migration_jobs` table definition.
    *   Modifying `update_data_migration_job_status` to accept and update the new `failed_rows` parameter.

## 4. Inconsistent Data Migration Callbacks
*   **Fix:** The `data_migration_row_callback` function and its corresponding entry in the `callback_map` within `worker.py` have been removed. The `data_migration_row_inserts_callback` is now the sole handler for row insertion logic, eliminating inconsistency.

## 5. Missing `execute_ddl_statement`
*   **Fix:** The `execute_ddl_statement` function has been implemented in `api/migration_db.py`. This function allows for the execution of DDL statements against the target PostgreSQL database, as required by the `data_migration_row_inserts_ddl_callback` in `worker.py`.

## 6. Fragile Ollama Model Name Determination
*   **Fix:** The `get_running_model_name` function in `api/ai_converter.py` has been made more robust. It now first attempts to find a running Ollama model using `ollama.ps()`, and if none are found, it falls back to returning the first available model from `ollama.list()`.

## 7. Potential SQL Splitting Limitations
*   **Fix:** A comment has been added to the `sanitize_for_execution` function in `api/sanitizer.py` to acknowledge the potential limitations of the current SQL splitting logic for complex Oracle dialects and to suggest future improvements.

## 8. Inefficient Job Retrieval
*   **Fix:** A comment has been added to the `get_job_table_names` function in `api/database.py` to highlight this as a future improvement area, suggesting centralizing job tracking for better efficiency.

## 9. Broad Database Privileges in Startup
*   **Fix:** The `api/startup.py` file has been modified to use more granular database privileges during initialization. Instead of `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE`, it now grants `USAGE` on the schema and `ALL PRIVILEGES` on all tables and sequences within the respective schemas (`migration_jobs` schema for `migration_jobs` user, and `public` schema for RAG user).

## 10. Duplicated `get_git_info` Function
*   **Fix:** The `get_git_info` function was found to be correctly imported from `ui/gradio_callbacks.py` and used in `app.py`. No code duplication was present in `app.py` itself, so no changes were required in this file beyond confirming correct usage of the imported function.
