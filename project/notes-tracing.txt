The StatusCode.UNAVAILABLE error indicates that your application cannot connect to the trace collector (Jaeger/OpenTelemetry Collector) at
  my-jaeger-collector:4317. This usually happens if the collector isn't running, or if the hostname/port is incorrect.

  Here's how to address both issues:

  1. Resolving StatusCode.UNAVAILABLE Error

   1. Verify Jaeger/Collector Status: Ensure your Jaeger instance or OpenTelemetry Collector is running and accessible. If you're running
      Jaeger in Docker, make sure the container is up and the ports are correctly mapped.
       * If you're running Jaeger locally using the command I provided in tracing.md:

   1         docker run -d --name jaeger \
   2           -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true \
   3           -p 16686:16686 \
   4           -p 4317:4317 \
   5           -p 4318:4318 \
   6           jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
          Then your application should connect to http://localhost:4317.

   2. Check `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`:
       * If running locally: Make sure the OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT environment variable is either not set (so it defaults to
         http://localhost:4317) or explicitly set to http://localhost:4317.

   1         # Option 1: Unset the variable if it's pointing to 'my-jaeger-collector'
   2         unset OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
   3
   4         # Option 2: Explicitly set it
   5         export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4317"
       * If running in Docker Compose: If your application and Jaeger are in the same Docker Compose network, my-jaeger-collector should be
         the service name of your Jaeger container. Ensure the service name matches and the port is correct.

  2. Getting the Trace ID for Searching

  To get the trace ID, you can extract it from the current OpenTelemetry span and log it. This allows you to easily find the trace in
  Jaeger/Zipkin by searching for that ID.

  I'll add a simple logging mechanism to api/main.py to demonstrate how to get the trace ID for each request.
