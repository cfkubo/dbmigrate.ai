The core of the problem is the networking daemon for Colima/Lima. It failed to start, causing the vmnet.sock: connect: connection refused error and the missing daemon.pid file.

Since the error happened while trying to start with or without the --network-address flag, the most effective solution is to stop, delete, and restart your Colima instance to force a clean regeneration of the network configuration files.

Here are the recommended steps, from least destructive to most destructive:

1. Simple Restart (Recommended First Step)
This attempts to cleanly shut down the Colima VM and restart the entire process.

Bash

# 1. Stop the instance to clean up any running processes
colima stop

# 2. Start the instance again
# Use the exact command you were using previously:
colima start --arch x86_64 --memory 4
# or if you prefer the default network:
# colima start --arch x86_64 --memory 4
2. Cleanup Network Files (If Restart Fails)
If the simple restart doesn't work, the network configuration files (vmnet.sock, daemon.pid, etc.) are likely corrupt or stale. You can target the specific network folder for cleanup.

Bash

# 1. Stop Colima first (if it's still stuck)
colima stop

# 2. Remove the specific network configuration folder
# This folder is what stores the state of the failed network daemon.
# Note: This is an internal Lima/Colima folder; proceed with caution, but it's a common fix.
rm -rf /Users/avannala/.colima/_lima/_networks/user-v2

# 3. Start Colima again
colima start --arch x86_64 --memory 4
3. Delete and Recreate (Most Reliable Fix)
This is the most effective solution, as it wipes the entire Colima VM and its configuration, forcing a fresh setup. Your existing Docker containers and images inside the VM will be lost, but the issue will almost certainly be resolved.

Bash

# 1. Stop the instance
colima stop

# 2. Delete the entire Colima instance and its VM
# This removes all configuration and the virtual disk.
colima delete

# 3. Start a fresh instance with your desired settings
# You must use the full command to recreate your specific setup:
colima start --arch x86_64 --memory 4 --network-address
# (You may be prompted for your macOS password here, which is necessary for the vmnet network daemon to run.)
Note on Architectures: Since you're running Colima on macOS (likely Apple Silicon, given the log entries about "Apple silicon") with --arch x86_64, you are running an emulated Intel VM. This setup is more prone to networking issues than the native aarch64 architecture
